\subsection{State}
%State content
\begin{enumerate}
\item This is our diagram for the state of the system:\\
\includegraphics[scale=.25]{state-diagram}
\item The formal definition of \emph{numbers} is as follows:
\[ numbers \ : \ \mathbb{P}\ PhoneNumberType \]
\item The relation \emph{recorded} must indeed be captured by a function. A function, by definition, enforces that each element of a source set (that is, the set in the domain) is mapped to exactly one element of a target set (a set of elements in the range). Part of the requirements for the system is that people may not share phone numbers. By making \emph{recorded} a function, and setting the \emph{numbers} set as a subset of the domain, the requirement of a phone number being associated to a single person is trivially met. If this is not done, an additional series of specifications must be defined such that this requirement is observed \emph{at best}, and at worst, there is a severe risk of failing to meet the defined requirements. Thus, it is at least convenient, if not necessary that \emph{recorded} is a function where \emph{numbers} is a subset of the domain. 
\newpage
\item The domain of \emph{recorded} is \emph{numbers}, and its codomain is \emph{NameType}.
\item The function \emph{recorded} is a partial function, because partial functions, by definition, do not map all elements in the domain to an element in the co-domain. Specifically, \emph{recorded} doesnâ€™t relate every element of PhoneNumberType to NameType.
\item The function \emph{recorded} will not be either injective, surjective, or bijective. It cannot be injective because an injective function, by definition, is a function where one element in the domain is mapped to at most one element in the co-domain, but recorded allows for multiple phone numbers to be associated with one person, so multiple parts of the domain could be associated with an element of the co-domain. It cannot be surjective as a surjective function, by definition, is a function where each element in the co-domain has at least one element in the domain mapped to it. In \emph{recorded}, there are elements contained in the co-domain of \emph{recorded} that are not in the range of \emph{recorded} therefore there exists elements in the codomain which are not mapped to by any element of the domain. It cannot be bijective because a bijective function is both injective and surjective and it has already been proven that this function is neither. Therefore, \emph{recorded} must be a general function because every element in the domain is mapped to one element of the co-domain, but more than one element of the domain can be mapped to the same element of the co-domain.
\item The formal definition of \emph{recorded} is as follows:
\[ recorded \ : \ PhoneNumberType \pfun NameType \]
